One of the major functions of an operating system is providing a user interface. The OS contains essentially how your screen will look when you are using your computer. It allows users to easily click on files, open programs, and manage settings. Instead of only looking at blocks of code, the operating system makes the computer user friendly and lets people use it without the knowledge of how it actually works.
Another major function of an operating system is the ability to run or execute files. The OS will pull the necessary information from storage and placing it in memory. Operating systems allow users to multitask and run multiple programs at one time, and even allocate or move around resources to multitask. 
A third major function of an operating system is to detect and fix potential errors. Most operating systems have built in utility programs designed to fix errors within the OS itself. Self-diagnosis is key to keeping a computer functioning in peak condition. One example of a program like this is Windows Troubleshooter. The user can run various searches in which the program will find and fix any errors.
