One of the major functions of an operating system is providing a user interface. The OS contains essentially how your screen will look when you are using your computer. It allows users to easily click on files, open programs, and manage settings. Instead of only looking at blocks of code, the operating system makes the computer user friendly and lets people use it without the knowledge of how it actually works.
